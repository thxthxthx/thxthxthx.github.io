			<h2>Star Wars 40th Anniversary</h2>
			<time class="date">28 May 2017</time>
			<p>Star Wars was released 40 years ago on the 25th of May 1997.<br>
			I think the best hommage made to this film did not happen this year, or this month, as the anniversary date came closer.<br>
			In fact, the best hommage made to the original Star Wars film happened last year in Januray 2016 when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpEWR0MBy6-Ou2HdFKUhOTQ">Tom F</a> released his modern trailer on YouTube.<br>
			This modern trailer uses the musical score from The Force Awakens' trailer. The fact that such a strong fan made trailer edit of a 40 year film can be so strong and powerful just confirms how modern Star Wars was, how modern Star Wars still is.

			<p>This modern trailer for Star Wars is fact the second that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpEWR0MBy6-Ou2HdFKUhOTQ">Tom F</a> made for the saga. His first Star Wars modern trailer was in fact for The Empire Strikes Back and it feels even better!<br>
