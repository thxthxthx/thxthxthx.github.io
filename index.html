              <p>What is the Force? Obi-Wan, Yoda, Luke Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano beautifully explain the Force.</p>
              <p>The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
              <br>It's an energy field created by all living things.
              <br>It surrounds us and penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.
              <br>Life creates it, makes it grow.
              <br>Its energy surrounds us and binds us.
              <br>Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.
              <br>You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes.

              <br>It's a tension, a balance that binds the universe together.

              <p>Eventhough legal, this is a low move for Disney and I hope that Lucasfilm had nothing to do with this. I genuinely think Disney saved Star Wars when it bought it from George Lucas. I like The Last Jedi and Solo even with their obvious flaws and the bad story choices, and bad dialog choices, that cheapened (even damaged) the established Star Wars lore.</p>

                <p>George Lucas recently reveals what his intentions were for the sequel trilogy during James Cameron's Story of Science Fiction.</p>
                <p>Lucas talks about a micro world, where Force users are just vehicles for the 'Whills' and they communicate with the Force users via the midi-chlorians.</p>
                <p>What a terrible idea this is, as if George Lucas had not done enough damage to Star Wars with prequel trilogy and the midi-chlorians.</p>
                <p>Lucas had visited the set of Rogue One, apparently making some suggestions, and also visited the set of 'Solo' apparently fixing/improving a scene. It would be good to know which scene and what was the original plan for it.</p>
                <p>Disney should involve Gary Kurtz.</p>

              <p>The editing merges perfectly choosen Rogue One moments with an instrumental music that is strong and soft at the same time, raising all the melancolie of the Rogue One story and its characters ultimate fate.</p>

              <h2>Star Wars 40th Anniversary</h2>
              <p>25 May 2017</p>
              <p>Star Wars was released 40 years ago on the 25th of May 1997.</p>
              <p>The best hommage made to original Star Wars film did not happen this year, or this month, as the anniversary date came closer, the best hommage made to the original Star Wars film happened last year in Januray 2016 when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpEWR0MBy6-Ou2HdFKUhOTQ" target="_blank">Tom F</a> released "Star Wars: A New Hope - Modern Trailer" on YouTube.</p>
              <p>This modern trailer uses the musical score from The Force Awakens' trailer. The fact fan made trailer of a 40 year film can be so strong and so powerful just confirms that Star Wars was just ahead of it time and was simply ground breaking.</p>
